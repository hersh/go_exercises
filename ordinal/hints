See fungame/hints to learn about reading numbers from standard input.

Most numbers when converted to "ordinal" are just the number followed
by the letters "th", like 5th or 77th.  There are 3 other
possibilities though.  Numbers whose last digit is 1, 2, or 3 should
use "st", "nd", or "rd", respectively.

To find the last digit of a number in decimal, use the "modulo" operator, "%".

  a % b

Returns the remainder when you divide integer a by integer b.

The last digit of a positive integer (and this assignment only cares
about positive integers) can be found by doing:

  number % 10

If you have a lot of similar "if" statements to write, you can
sometimes put them together in a switch statement.  For example:

  switch foo {
  case 3:
          fmt.Println("three")
  case 4:
          fmt.Println("four")
  case 5:
          fmt.Println("five")
  default:
          fmt.Println("some other number")
  }

Is the same as:

  if foo == 3 {
          fmt.Println("three")
  } else if foo == 4 {
          fmt.Println("four")
  } else if foo == 5 {
          fmt.Println("five")
  } else {
          fmt.Println("some other number")
  }

Both are the same number of lines, but perhaps the "switch" version is
a little less cluttered to read.
