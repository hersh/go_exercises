Write a program which plays a numerical version of twenty questions.

This is like "fungame" but more fun. :)

The program should say:

  Think of an integer between 1 and 1000000.
  Now I'll try to guess it, using 20 questions or less.

Then it should ask a question.  It can ask if the number is greater
than some number, like so:

  Is the number greater than 3?

And it can ask if the number is equal to something, like this:

  Is the number 15899?

All answers should be "yes" or "no".

If your program asks if the number is a specific one and the user
answers "yes", the program wins.  If the program asks 20 questions
without finding the right number, the user wins.

Even though there are a million possibilities and you only have 20
questions, your program should be able to win every time.
