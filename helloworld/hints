Every go file starts with a "package" line, saying which package it is
part of.  To make an executable instead of a library, name the package
"main".  The package line then looks like this:

  package main

Next we import other libraries needed by this file.  If only one
library is needed, it can be imported on one line like this:

  import "fmt"

This imports a text formatting package.

To import multiple packages, you can say import once and put the list
of packages in a parenthesized list, like so:

  import (
          "fmt"
          "os"
  )

When writing an executable, there must exist a function called "main",
taking no arguments and returning nothing.  That looks like this:

  func main() {
  }

To print text followed by a newline, use the "Println" function in
package fmt:

  fmt.Println("my text")
