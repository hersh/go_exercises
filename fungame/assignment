Implement fungame. It is a number-guessing game. The computer does the guessing.
The computer always guesses 7.  Here's a sample transcript:

  Welcome to fun game.
  You think of a number and I'll try to guess it.
  Is it 7? no
  Is it 7? maybe
  Is it 7? yes
  Yay, I win!

The user types "no", "maybe", and "yes" in this example.  The program
prints all the other text.  If the user types "yes", the computer wins
and the program ends.  Otherwise it just repeats asking "Is it 7?".
