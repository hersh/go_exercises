Implement the "yes" unix command in Go.

If you run it with no arguments,

  go run yes.go

it just prints "yes" over and over, forever:

  yes
  yes
  yes
  yes
...etc.

If you give it command line arguments like so:

  go run yes.go I love you

it prints all the arguments over and over, forever, like so:

  I love you
  I love you
  I love you
  I love you
...etc.
