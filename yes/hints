Without the command-line arguments requirement, this program is very simple.

Command line arguments are described in printn/hints.

Here you want to build up a string containing all the command line
arguments separated by spaces.

To combine two strings, you use the "+" operator, like so:

  s1 = "foo"
  s2 = "bar"
  s = s1 + s2

Now s is "foobar".

If you want to grow the same string more and more, you can use something like:

  s = ""
  s = s + "foo"
  s = s + "bar"

Now s is "foobar" again.

Each time you do the assignment like s = s + "foo", you are saying the
new value of the variable s should be the result of adding the old
variable s and the string "foo".

The pattern of "v = v + something" is so common in programming, there
is a shortcut for it: "v += something".  Both do the same thing, both
are valid.
