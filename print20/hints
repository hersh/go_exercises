To make a counting loop, write a "for" loop of this form:

  for i := 7; i < 35; i++ {
  }

This declares a new variable "i" (because of the ":=" instead of "=")
and assigns it to the numbers 7, 8, etc up through 34.

The middle ("i < 35") tells the loop to keep going *while* i is less
than 35.  So of course when i becomes 35, it is no longer less than
35, so the loop is not executed with i equal to 35.

The last part says how to change i after each time through.  In this
case, it says to increment it.

To print a number (and a newline) to stdout, you can use the
fmt.Println() function.  Just put the variable you want to print
inside the parentheses.
