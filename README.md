Golang exercises for beginning programmers
==========================================

Each exercise subdirectory has 3 files:

* **assignment**: description of the assignment
* **hints**: hints to help you along
* Source file: A source file giving my answer to the exercise if you want to look and see how I did part of it.  Named for the exercise.

These are intended to be ordered in order of increasing difficulty.
